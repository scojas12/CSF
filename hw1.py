### Problem 1
###

print "Problem 1 solution follows:"
a = 1
b = -5.86
c = 8.5408
x1 = (-b+math.sqrt(b**2-4*a*c))/(2*a)
x2 = (-b-math.sqrt(b**2-4*a*c))/(2*a)
print "of the function: x^2 - 5.86x + 8.5408 the roots are"

print x1,"and", x2


# This uses the quadratic formula to solve for 2 roots when the determinant is 
# greater than 0
