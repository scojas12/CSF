Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:
python dna_analysis.py data/sample_1.fastq

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

The program fails because the name "linenum" is not defined.
This happened due to the fact that we commented out linenum = 0
thereby erasing the variable's value, later needed.

if we were to comment out "gc_count = 0" the program would lose value
for the variable "gc_count" and later when it is referenced,
the program would have no value to reference and not understand "gc_count".

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.215146314815
AT-content: 0.284496925926

Collaboration:

...

Reflection:

For some reason the program kept retiring syntax errorsâ€¦ until friday night
 when running the program randomly returned the GC-content so i could start
fun assignment once it starts working!
