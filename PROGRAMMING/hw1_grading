3/3

The code is efficient; only complaint in terms of code aesthetic is that
I, personally, would have printed the answers to problem 2 on separate
lines, or separated them visually somehow.

The grammatically correct way of phrasing "of the function: 
x^2 - 5.86x + 8.5408 the roots are" would be
"the roots of the function x^2 - 5.86x + 8.5408 are:", but this is
simply for basic clarity and does not impede the code's execution.

The code is functional and not inelegant. It does as much could be
asked of it.
