<h3>
Problem 5 (Assignment)
</h3>

<ul>
<li>Write code that assigns a number (like 22) to a variable
named <tt>x</tt> using one equals sign (=).
</li>
<li>
Write code that receives the value of the assignment,
using similar syntax to this: <tt>y = (x = 22)</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Print the value of <tt>y</tt>
</li>
<li>
Assign the value of another assignment using a
different type, like a string, similar to this:
<tt>z = (x = "blah")</tt>
</li>
<li>
Print the value of <tt>x</tt>
</li>
<li>
In comments, answer in English what the value of an
assignment is (the values of <tt>y</tt> and <tt>z</tt>
above). Is this value always the same?
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Problem 6 (Equality)
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Write code that assigns value of an equality comparison
between two integers to
a variable called <tt>w</tt>, like this: <tt>w = (1 == 2)</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Print the value of <tt>w</tt>. Is this what you expected?
</li>
<li>
In a separate line of code, after the ones above, write another
assignment to <tt>w</tt> using two different values in order
to get a different value for <tt>w</tt> than you got above.
Print out this new value of <tt>w</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Answer in English in the comments the difference between
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Problem 4 (Calling Functions)
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Define a function (call it anything) that returns a number
(either an integer or a float).
</li>
<li>
Call this function and store its return value in a variable
called <tt>a</tt>
</li>
<li>
Compare the return value of this function call to a number
literal (like 22), and assign the value of this comparison
to a new variable <tt>d</tt>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Problem 3 (Comparisons as Boolean Expressions)
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Define a function (call it anything) that returns a number
(either an integer or a float).
</li>
<li>
Call this function, and compare its return value to another
number (either an integer or a float).
</li>
<li>
Assign the value of this comparison to a variable called
<tt>result</tt>. Do this using the syntax: <tt>result = (a == b)</tt>,
but substituting your expression of the previous part as <tt>a</tt>
or <tt>b</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Print the type of the variable <tt>result</tt>.
What is it? Answer this in English in the comments of your code.
</li>
<li>
Try a different comparison, this time between strings.
Write two comparisons, between string literals that should be equal
and those that should be false, and print out the type and
the value of their comparisons.
</li>
<li>
Are your answers the same for comparing numbers as comparing strings?
Would they be the same for any other types?
Answer this in English in the comments of your code.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Problem 7 (Assert Statement)
</h3>

<p>
Explain what happens in English when you execute the following.
Put these in comments in your <tt>hw6.py</tt>.
</p>
<ul>
</li>
<li>
<tt>assert True</tt>
</li>
<li>
<tt>assert False</tt>
</li>
<li>
Write Python code that calls <code>assert</code> with a boolean expression
that you expect to be true.
</li>
<li>
Write Python code that calls <code>assert</code> with a boolean expression
that you expect to be false.
</li>
<li>
Write Python code that calls <code>assert</code> with a boolean expression
that uses the return value of a function call, like you did above
in Problem 3.
</li>
<li>
Explain in English, in the comments of your code, the detailed behavior
of an <tt>assert</tt> statement in the different circumstances you
observed above.
</li>
</ul>
