<h3>
Problem 3 (Comparisons as Boolean Expressions)
</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Define a function (call it anything) that returns a number
(either an integer or a float).
</li>
<li>
Call this function, and compare its return value to another
number (either an integer or a float).
</li>
<li>
Assign the value of this comparison to a variable called
<tt>result</tt>. Do this using the syntax: <tt>result = (a == b)</tt>,
but substituting your expression of the previous part as <tt>a</tt>
or <tt>b</tt>.
</li>
<li>
Print the type of the variable <tt>result</tt>.
What is it? Answer this in English in the comments of your code.
</li>
<li>
Try a different comparison, this time between strings.
Write two comparisons, between string literals that should be equal
and those that should be false, and print out the type and
the value of their comparisons.
</li>
<li>
Are your answers the same for comparing numbers as comparing strings?
Would they be the same for any other types?
Answer this in English in the comments of your code.
</li>
</ul>
